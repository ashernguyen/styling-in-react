2. Introduction about component-based-design

Component-based design, or atomic design is breaking down the elements that make up a website into their smallest iterations—for example, 
a button or a headline—and then reassembling those elements back into components like a search block or a news item. 
The components are then used in various configurations to standardize templates which are then iterated as pages to the end user.

3. Benefits of component-based-design

With collaborative, up-front planning, a clear pathway is laid out for designers, developers and content creators.
Making clear the goals and deliverables of the website build. Patterns and templates are established to remove the guesswork during the development process.
Much of the back and forth conversation that may have happened previously is greatly reduced or eliminated.
Now all parties have a toolkit to work with to make the process more agile and make changes efficiently.
No need to go back to the drawing board. New ideas can be quickly iterated and deployed.
Modifications can be made to existing components without having to redesign from scratch.
Early testing of layout and user interactions benefits from this methodology, as it allows the entire team to discover problem areas early on and address them well before anything is deployed.

4. What is styled-system?

Styled-System provides you with a set of utilities that map props to your design system. 
It uses the concept of style functions.
Each style function exposes its own set of props that style elements based on values defined in your design system theme. 
It has a rich API with functions for most CSS properties.
